Personal Website
Pages: /recruiting :
  this is an interactive, unbiased college football recruiting page which I created to practice my skills using JS, Python, Front-end Web Development using HTML/CSS3, class objects, and JS animation to create dynamic websites.
  this also paired with my interest (at least at the time) of college football recruiting services such as 247, ON3, etc.
